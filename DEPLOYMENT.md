# üöÄ AdShield AI Deployment Guide

Since Railway doesn't support monorepo subfolder deployment directly, we've prepared two separate folders that can be deployed as independent repositories:

## üìÅ Repository Structure

```
AdShield AI/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ adshield-backend/    # Backend API (deploy to Railway)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ adshield-frontend/   # Frontend UI (deploy to Vercel)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DEPLOYMENT.md        # This file
```

## üîß Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Create Two GitHub Repositories

Create two separate repositories on GitHub:
1. `adshield-backend` - For the backend API
2. `adshield-frontend` - For the frontend UI

### Step 2: Deploy Backend to Railway

```bash
# Navigate to backend folder
cd "C:\AdShield AI\adshield-backend"

# Initialize git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: AdShield Backend API"

# Push to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/adshield-backend.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**On Railway:**
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Create New Project ‚Üí Deploy from GitHub repo
3. Select `adshield-backend` repository
4. Railway will auto-detect Python and create the service
5. Go to Variables tab and add:
   ```
   HF_API_TOKEN=hf_your_actual_token_here
   FRONTEND_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
   PORT=8000
   ```
6. Railway will automatically deploy!
7. Copy your Railway backend URL (e.g., `https://adshield-backend.up.railway.app`)

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend to Vercel

```bash
# Navigate to frontend folder
cd "C:\AdShield AI\adshield-frontend"

# Initialize git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: AdShield Frontend"

# Push to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/adshield-frontend.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**On Vercel:**
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Import Project ‚Üí Import Git Repository
3. Select `adshield-frontend` repository
4. Framework Preset will auto-detect as Vite
5. Add Environment Variable:
   ```
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://adshield-backend.up.railway.app
   ```
   (Use your actual Railway backend URL)
6. Deploy!

## üîÑ Alternative: Using Railway with Monorepo

If you prefer to keep everything in one repository, you can use Railway's `railway.json` configuration:

1. Create `railway.json` in your backend folder:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "cd backend && uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT:-8000}",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

2. Deploy the entire repository to Railway
3. Railway will use the configuration to run from the backend folder

## üìù Important URLs to Remember

After deployment, you'll have:
- **Backend API**: `https://your-backend.up.railway.app`
- **Frontend App**: `https://your-app.vercel.app`

Make sure to:
1. Update `FRONTEND_URL` in Railway to your Vercel URL
2. Update `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in Vercel to your Railway URL
3. Test all features after deployment

## üîê Security Checklist

- [ ] Never commit `.env` files to GitHub
- [ ] Use strong, unique Hugging Face API token
- [ ] Set `DEBUG=False` in production
- [ ] Configure CORS properly for your domains
- [ ] Use HTTPS for both frontend and backend

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### CORS Issues
If you get CORS errors:
1. Check that `FRONTEND_URL` in Railway matches your Vercel URL exactly
2. Include `https://` or `http://` in the URL
3. Restart the Railway service after changing environment variables

### API Connection Issues
If frontend can't connect to backend:
1. Verify `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is set correctly in Vercel
2. Check that backend is running (visit the Railway URL directly)
3. Look at Railway logs for any errors

### Deployment Fails
If Railway deployment fails:
1. Check Python version in `runtime.txt` (should be `python-3.11.9`)
2. Verify all dependencies in `requirements.txt` are correct
3. Check Railway build logs for specific errors

## üéâ Success!

Once both are deployed and connected, your AdShield AI platform will be live and ready to protect users from scams!

Visit your Vercel URL to start using the application.
